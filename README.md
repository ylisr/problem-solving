Working on classic interview questions, adding my thoughts and notes

2017/01/13  
I've finished the [Swift Apprentice](https://www.raywenderlich.com/store/swift-apprentice) book and you can see my notes in Swift Apprentice Challenges playground series.

[Advanced Swift](https://www.objc.io/books/advanced-swift/) book in progress, trying to implement all key data structures.
